WINDECO is a Smart solution that allows you to control the windows that you have in a certain room. The project consists of a control unit and a window. 
The control unit continuously sends the environmental parameters (such as brightness, CO2 level and infrared signals) collected via Bluetooth. The unit has a LCD screen and a handy infrared remote control that can be used by users who want to directly control the window without using its automatic mode, or to set a desired brightness in the room (in percentage) to enforce the system to respect it. On the window 2 brightness sensors are installed, they allow the system to know whether it’s day or night. That is predicted thanks to the reading of the external brightness by the two sensors. There’s also an air recirculation pump connected to the window which is turned on whenever the central unit detects a dangerous level of CO2.
