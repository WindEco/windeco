WINDECO is a Smart solution that allows you to control the windows that you have in a given room. The project consists of a control unit and the window itself. 
The control unit continuously sends data of the environmental parameters collected via Bluetooth, such as brightness (which can be set by the user via remote), CO2 level and infrared signals. The unit has a LCD screen and a handy infrared remote control that can be used by users who want to directly control the window without using its automatic mode, or to set a desired brightness in the room (in percentage) to enforce the system to respect it. On the window there are installed 2 brightness sensors that allow the system to know whether it’s day or night. That is predicted thanks to the reading of the external brightness by the two sensors. There’s also an air recirculation pump connected to the window which is turned on whenever the central unit detects a dangerous level of CO2.
